# apple-music-load
Converts and uploads your music directly to iTunes (Apple Music).

Recursivily finds all MP3 and FLAC files in the current directory and uploads them to iTunes.  
Flac files will be converted to MP3 because iTunes doesn't support FLAC.

Usage:
```sh
# Go to the directory with your music (or root directory)
cd my-music

# Start uploading
apple-music-load
```
